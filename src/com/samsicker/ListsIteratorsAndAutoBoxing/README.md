//ArrayList
- The arrayList is a class that contains an array in memory that is bigger that what we need is most cases
- Keeps track of the  max size of the array (capacity)
- Keeps track of the assigned elements which is the actual size of the arrayList
- When declaring the arrayList, always include the type argument.
- This makes sure you have the compile time type checking
- Arrays are not resizable but arrayList are
- An array requires brackets on the declaration side and are initated with size in square brackets on the right
- An arrayList should be declared with the type of element in angle brackets
- In arrayLists, we can use list constructor eg: List.of() 
- When you create an array list by wrapping an array; the original array is impacted on by all manipulations of the arrayList
