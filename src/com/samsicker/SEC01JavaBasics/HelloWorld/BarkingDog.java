//Barking Dog
//We have a dog that likes to bark.  We need to wake up if the dog is barking at night!

//Write a method shouldWakeUp that has 2 parameters.
//
//1st parameter should be of type boolean and be named barking it represents if our dog is currently barking.
//2nd parameter represents the hour of the day and is of type int with the name hourOfDay and has a valid range of 0-23.
//
//We have to wake up if the dog is barking before 8 or after 22 hours so in that case return true.
//
//In all other cases return false.
//
//If the hourOfDay parameter is less than 0 or greater than 23 return false.
