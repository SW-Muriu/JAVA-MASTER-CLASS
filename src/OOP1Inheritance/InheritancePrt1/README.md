1. Use extends to pass a superclass in a child class
2. A child class can only have one super class
3. Super() is used to call the default constructor in the superclass, and operates like this(), which calls the constructor
4. Default constructors are the noargs constructor
5. Must be called as the first in a method, just like constructors
6. Hence this() and super() cannot be called in the same method

1. Overriding a method is when you create a method on a subclass, which has the same signature as a method in a super class
2. Used in extending or delimitting the operations of a superclass method, within the sub class or creating a new behavior
