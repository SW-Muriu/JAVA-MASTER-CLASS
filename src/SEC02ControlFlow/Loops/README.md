There are three loops
1. For Loop
   Used when iterating over a set of values
    Takes these parameters. The initialization, the expression, and the increment part. They are all optional
    A break statement transfers control out of an enclosing statement
    Use an if statement in the loop to check a conidtion
2. While Loop
   Executes until a given condition becomes false
3. Do while loop
    Executes at least once and continues until a given condition becomes false

While using the While loop, you can can use continue to skip, where the number that returns true for the condition, is skipped
Used the same as if-break



Local variables are always in scope in the block they are declared
They are also in scope for any nested blocks contained within the outer block
Declare variables in the narrowest scope possible
Declare and intialize variables at the same place where possible
