    Takes these parameters. The initialization, the expression, and the increment part. They are all optional
    A break statement transfers control out of an enclosing statement
    Use an if statement in the loop to check a conidtion
2. While Loop
   Executes until a given condition becomes false
3. Do while loop
    Executes at least once and continues until a given condition becomes false
