Encapsulation is hiding things by making them private or inaccessible
An API is a public contract that tells others how to use the class

//Encapsulation principles
1. create constructors for object initialization, which guarantees that only objects with valid data will be created
2. use the private access modifier for your fields
3. use setter methods sparingly and only as needed
4. use access modifiers that aren't private, only for the methods that the calling code needs to use
